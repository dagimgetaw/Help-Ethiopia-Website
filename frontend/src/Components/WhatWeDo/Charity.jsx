          Every day, we witness the transformative power of compassion through
          our Eteye Charity. From covering medical expenses for struggling
          families to ensuring access to life-saving treatments, weâ€™re there for
          our community when they need us most. Through our charity Program, we
          have been supporting many patients on treatment primarily in Tikur
          Anbessa Specialized hospital (TASH). These patients have passed
          through many hardships to come to hospital and most were about to quit
          the care and go to their hometown without completing their treatment.

          In Eteye Health Charity, we accept request for support from treating
          doctors, nurses and patients themselves. We work closely with social
          workers and care providers in identifying eligible patients and reach
          out to them to cover their expenses for medications, imaging and
          laboratory tests.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md md:text-lg leading-8 md:leading-9 font-text">
          We continue our support until they showed visible improvement in their
          clinical condition and get discharged. Nevertheless, due to our
          limited financial capacity and the demand is too high, we could not
          reach to more patients with treatable disease.
