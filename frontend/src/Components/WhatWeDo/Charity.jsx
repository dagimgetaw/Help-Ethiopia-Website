            Every day, we witness the transformative power of compassion through
            our Eteye Charity. From covering medical expenses for struggling
            families to ensuring access to life-saving treatments, weâ€™re there
            for our community when they need us most. Through our charity
            Program, we have been supporting many patients on treatment
            primarily in Tikur Anbessa Specialized hospital (TASH). These
            patients have passed through many hardships to come to hospital and
            most were about to quit the care and go to their hometown without
            completing their treatment.

            In Eteye Health Charity, we accept request for support from treating
            doctors, nurses and patients themselves. We work closely with social
            workers and care providers in identifying eligible patients and
            reach out to them to cover their expenses for medications, imaging
            and laboratory tests.
          </p>

            We continue our support until they showed visible improvement in
            their clinical condition and get discharged. Nevertheless, due to
            our limited financial capacity and the demand is too high, we could
            not reach to more patients with treatable disease.
