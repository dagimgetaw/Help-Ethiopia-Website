        HELP Ethiopia is a multidisciplinary non-profit organization that has
        been registered and accorded legal personality in Ethiopia with registry
        number 5623. Committed to improving healthcare, we collaborate with
        local and international stakeholders to address neglected areas of
        health service delivery and training. We also have a dedicated charity
        program targeting economically disadvantaged groups of our society-
        Ye’Eteye health Charity. Furthermore, we advocate for quality education,
        leadership and collaboration as a tool for sustainable health care and
        societal development. Hence the name “HELP” which stands for Health,
        Education, Leadership and Partnership.
