            HELP Ethiopia is a multidisciplinary non-profit organization that
            has been registered and accorded legal personality in Ethiopia with
            registry number 5623. Committed to improving healthcare, we
            collaborate with local and international stakeholders to address
            neglected areas of health service delivery and training. We also
            have a dedicated charity program targeting economically
            disadvantaged groups of our society- Ye&apos;Eteye health Charity.
            Furthermore, we advocate for quality education, leadership and
            collaboration as a tool for sustainable health care and societal
            development. Hence the name &quot;HELP&quot; which stands for
            Health, Education, Leadership and Partnership.
